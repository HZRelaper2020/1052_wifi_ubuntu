KRACK WiFi WPA2 security exploits - Oct 2017
============================================
The CVEs associated with the KRACK attack can be grouped into three groups.

GROUP 1
=======
  * CVE-2017-13077
  * CVE-2017-13078
  * CVE-2017-13079
In WICED Studio, the supplicant functionality is implemented in the firmware that runs on the specific Cypress
Wi-Fi chipsets. The following WICED chipsets have vulnerable firmware implementations for this group of
CVEs: 43364, 43438 and 4343W. The firmware on these chipsets have been updated to address these exploits.

GROUP 2
=======
  * CVE-2017-13080
  * CVE-2017-13081
All versions of firmware used in WICED releases contain the vulnerabilities from Group 2 in the supplicant
function - 43364, 43438, 4343W, 43909, 43907, 54907, 43903, 43362, 43340. The firmware on these chipsets
have been updated to address these CVEs.

GROUP 3
=======
  * CVE-2017-13082
  * CVE-2017-13084
  * CVE-2017-13086
  * CVE-2017-13087
  * CVE-2017-13088
Cypress chipsets and current software releases are not affected by these CVEs.

Broadpwn exploits - July 2017
=============================

Firmware patches:
=================

 * BROADPWN: Remotely compromising Android and IoS via a bug in Broadcom's Wi-Fi chipsets

=======================================
Google project zero exploits - May 2017
=======================================
Google project zero targets for security loop holes in Broadcom wifi chip.

WICED WWD was written completely separately from DHD but it is in our best interests to ensure that any exploits
identified by Google on DHD are not also present in WWD. Unfortunately this is not just an application of patches
as the code bases are so different but instead requires reviewing the WWD code to understand if there are similar
operations (stack overflows, buffer overflows etc.) exploitable on the WWD.

The following exploits have been analyzed and  found that only one of them is applicable to the WICED host side.

The firmware security patches are common for DHD as well as WICED and it has been applied to the firmware release.


List of the patches relevant to DHD but not to WICED
=====================================================

  * CVE-2017-0509: Obsolete Wireless Extension APIs
  * CVE-2017-0567: 802.11u (Interworking with External Networks) IE length buffer overflow
  * CVE-2017-0568: P2P channel list buffer overflow
  * CVE-2017-0569: Buffer overflow in Preferred Network Event handling
  * CVE-2017-0570: Buffer overflow during SSID query
  * CVE-2017-0571: Buffer overflow in Rx data flow control processing
  * CVE-2017-0574: Buffer overflow in vendor extension code for debug memory dump
  * CVE-2016-8453: Kernel panic due to invalid PCIe access while bus is down
  * CVE-2016-8454: Buffer overflow in vendor extension code for GSCAN-PNO and NL-TLV handlers
  * CVE-2016-8456: Memory overflow in vendor extension code for setting RTT configuration
  * CVE-2016-8466: Buffer overflow in msgbuf query ioctl handler
