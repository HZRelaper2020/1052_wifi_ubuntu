 * The Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) defines the protocols and procedures that
 * realize distribution of audio content of high-quality in mono or stereo on ACL channels. The
 * term "advanced audio", therefore, should be distinguished from "Bluetooth audio", which indicates
 * distribution of narrow band voice on SCO channels. A typical usage case is the streaming of music
 * content from a stereo music player to headphones or speakers. The audio data is compressed in a
 * proper format for efficient use of the limited bandwidth. Surround sound distribution is not included in
 * the scope of this profile.
