/**
 * AAC decoder wrapper for Fraunhofer AAC SDK (FDK)
 * Thi library is dedicated to the decoding of .m4a audio files
 * with a simplified API to decode an incoming packet stream into
 * PCM samples.
 *
 * this library does take care of "parsing" the MP4 syntax to
 * extract the audio samples, decode them by calling the FDK
 * and return the PCM stream to the upper layer (audio player)
 *
 * NOTE: this is not a fill MP4 demuxer, it is only a lightweigth
 * parser for audio files.
 *
 * since this library is oriented to the STREAMING use case there
 * is currenlty NO support for trick playback. Only START/STOP
 * are supported to allow continuos playback.
 *
 * During the create (new) call the application must specify
 * the requested channel map (same as APOLLO specification) and
 * PCM format targets. The library will internally convert to match
 * the requested format.
