/*
 * Audio client command notes:
 *
 * AUDIO_CLIENT_IOCTL_LOAD_FILE is used to download a text file from a web server. The downloaded
 * file is stored in a dynamically allocated buffer as a nul terminated string. The pointer to
 * the buffer is passed to the caller with the AUDIO_CLIENT_EVENT_HTTP_COMPLETE event. It is the
 * responsibility of the caller to free this buffer after use.
 *
 * When load_playlist_files is enabled, the library will generate a AUDIO_CLIENT_EVENT_PLAYLIST_MIME_TYPE
 * event when a playlist mime type is encountered, If the application returns WICED_TRUE, the library
 * will load the playlist into memory and generate a AUDIO_CLIENT_EVENT_HTTP_COMPLETE event with
 * the loaded playlist. The application is responsible for freeing the memory when done.
 *
 * AUDIO_CLIENT_IOCTL_SUSPEND is used to suspend current playback and return a pointer to an
 * allocated structure that contains the information that audio_client needs to resume the
 * playback session. When the suspend call returns, playback for the current session has been stopped.
 * If the application decides not to resume playback, the returned structure can be freed directly.
 *
 * AUDIO_CLIENT_IOCTL_SUSPEND_RESUME is used to resume a suspended playback session. The structure
 * that was allocated in the suspend processing will be freed automatically in the suspend resume
 * processing.
 *
 * AUDIO_CLIENT_IOCTL_SET_RAW_CONFIG is used to set the audio configuration for pushing raw PCM
 * buffers to audio_client. The decoders will be bypassed and the audio will be pushed directly
 * to the output pipeline. The audio configuration used must be a supported output configuration
 * with the exception that audio_client will automatically convert 16-bit mono input to 16-bit
 * stereo output.
