 *
 * Constrained application protocol (CoAP) is a specialized web transfer protocol for use with
 * constrained nodes and constrained (e.g., low power, lossy) networks which runs over UDP.
 * CoAP provides a request/response interaction model between application endpoints, supports
 * built in discovery of services & resources, and includes key concepts of the web such as URIs
 * and media types.
 *
 * CoAP server implementation on WICED provides APIs to register different services with server.
 * The library supports ping/pong, discovery of well-known services and various CoAP methods (GET,
 * POST, and DELETE). The CoAP server is capable of adding & removing observers for particular
 * resource & sending notification to observer [with retransmission for confirmable message types]
 * whenever resources are updated.
