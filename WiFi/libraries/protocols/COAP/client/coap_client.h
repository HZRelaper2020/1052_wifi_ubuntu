 * Constrained application protocol (CoAP) is a specialized web transfer protocol for use with
 * constrained nodes and constrained (e.g., low power, lossy) networks which runs over UDP.
 * CoAP provides a request/response interaction model between application endpoints, supports
 * built in discovery of services & resources, and includes key concepts of the web such as URIs
 * and media types.
 *
 * CoAP client implementation on WICED provides APIs to connect to CoAP cloud services
 * such as Exosite. The library supports various CoAP methods such as GET, POST & DELETE resources
 * from the server. The client Implementation also allows users to observe resources and receive
 * notification whenever the resource is updated.
