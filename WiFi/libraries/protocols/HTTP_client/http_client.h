 * Communication functions for HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) Client
 *
 * HTTP functions as a request-response protocol in the client-server computing model. A web browser,
 * for example, may be the client and an application running on a computer hosting a website may be the
 * server. The client submits an HTTP request message to the server. The server, which provides
 * resources such as HTML files and other content, or performs other functions on behalf of the client,
 * returns a response message to the client. The response contains completion status information about
 * the request and may also contain requested content in its message body.
 *
 * The HTTP client library on WICED is capable of both secure [with TLS security] and
 * non-secure mode of connection. The library also provides support for various RESTful HTTP methods
 * such as GET, POST and PUT; and has support for various content types [e.g. HTML, Plain, JSON].
 * The HTTP library is capable of handling content payload that is greater than MTU size.
