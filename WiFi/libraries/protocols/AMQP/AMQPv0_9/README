AMQP : Advanced Message Queueing Protocol
=====================================================================

What is AMQP?
-------------------------------------------
The Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) is an open standard for passing
messages between applications and/or organizations. For more information
regarding AMQP visit http://www.amqp.org/.

What versions are supported by WICED?
-------------------------------------------
WICED currently supports AMQP clients version 0.9-1. The AMQP sepcification for
AMQP version 0-9-1 can be found at http://www.amqp.org/resources/download. It
is important to realize that currently WICED doesn't support AMQP version 1.0.

What does the library look like ?
-------------------------------------------
The WICED AMQP client architecture is not far from the standard AMQP client
architecutre proposed in the AMQP standard. The AMQP  libarayr consists of 4
layers.

  - API layer: exposes the API for the applications to work this. The APIs
    maps almost one to one to the different methods the AMAP standard offers.

  - Connection manager layer: manages the overall connection and session logic.
    it encapsulates the full logic of openning connectsions. It also handles
    heart beats. The connection manger detects server errors (sending on a
    wrong channel), and server exctptions. However the connection manager
    doesn't protect against user errors of sending wrong sequence of packets
    (e.g sending a wrong size of data other than the published size).

  - Framing layer: takes AMQP methods (along with their parameters) and
    serialize them as wire-level frames. It also implments the other way
    around (ie. is parses a wire-level frame in an AMQP method and data).

  - Network layer: an IO layer responsible for sending and receiving data over
    the wires. It also implements TLS security (if required). The network
    layer implements a receiving thread and a transmiting thread. A user call-
    back for connection or a channel event is usually running from the context
    of the receiving thread. It is important to realize that callback shouldn't
    be stalled so much in order not to degrade the receiving performance of the
    libraray.

What are the limitations?
-------------------------------------------
The AMQP library is still under development and currently has a number of limitations:
- Some AMQP methods can send and receive tables which is a list any type of variables.
  Although WICED AMQP does suppot tables, however the maximum table size is currently
  set to 10 items (in amqp.h).
- WICED AMQP doesn't support nested tables (a table that includes another table).
- The AMQP manager doesn't detect user errors, although most likely the server will
  raise an exception which the connection manager will detect.
