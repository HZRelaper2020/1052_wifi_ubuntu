 *
 * Communication functions for AWS IoT & AWS Greengrass services
 *
 * AWS IoT provides secure, bi-directional communication between Internet-connected devices such as sensors,
 * actuators, embedded micro-controllers, or smart appliances and the AWS Cloud.
 *
 * AWS Greengrass is software that extends AWS cloud capabilities to local devices(typically Edge or Gateway devices),
 * making it possible for them to collect and analyze data closer to the source of information (Nodes, Wiced Devices, Amazon FreeRTOS devices).
 * With AWS Greengrass, devices securely communicate on a local network and exchange messages with each other
 * without having to connect to the cloud. AWS Greengrass provides a local pub/sub message manager that can
 * intelligently buffer messages if connectivity is lost so that inbound and outbound messages to the cloud are preserved.
 *
 * Wiced AWS library provides application developers an easy-to-use, unified interface for quickly enabling
 * AWS communication in their applications. The library provides a single interface to communicate with AWS
 * using different protocols. Currently, only MQTT & HTTP ( using Client Certificates )
 * are supported. See <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/protocols.html> for more details.
