 * Communication functions for MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport)
 *
 * MQTT is a publish-subscribe-based "lightweight" messaging protocol for use on top of the TCP/IP protocol.
 * It is designed for connections with remote locations where a "small code footprint" is required or the
 * network bandwidth is limited. The publish-subscribe messaging pattern requires a message broker.
 *
 * WICED implements MQTT version 3.1.1 client library i.e. the publisher and subscriber roles need the
 * support of a public/local broker to exchange data. The MQTT library supports CONNECT, DISCONNECT,
 * SUBSCRIBE, UNSUBSCRIBE, and PUBLISH methods. The current implementation has provision for QOS 0, 1 & 2.
 * The SUBSCRIBE method is capable of subscribing to one filter at a time. The MQTT client library on WICED is
 * capable of both secure [with TLS security] and non-secure mode of connection. MQTT core library internally
 * implements keep-alive mechanism.
