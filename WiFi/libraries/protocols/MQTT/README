What versions are supported by WICED?
-------------------------------------------
WICED currently supports MQTT clients version 3.1.1. The MQTT sepcification for
MQTT version 0-9-1 can be found at
https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/51356/mqtt-v3.1.1-wd15.pdf.

What are the limitations?
-------------------------------------------
The MQTT library is still under development and currently has a number of limitations:
- Subscribe method  currently supports subscribing one filter at a time.
- Frames are all created now with a size of 4K, a lot of packets (ACK, PINGREQ/RES, ect.)
  have smaller sizes and we should create packets based on the size not a big constant.
- The library needs more testing for all conrner cases and session resuming.
