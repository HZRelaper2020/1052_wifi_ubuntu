/** @file
 *  A tool to create a Wiced OTA Update Image
 *
 *  The tool takes an argument for a file that contains information to build the Image.
 *  Currently, we are using all the data included in the LUT table.
 *  We don't build the LUT, just use it and add all the components.
 *
 *  NOTES:
 *  - FR_APP and OTA_APP are for different WICED code, not expected to be used for this upgrade
 *  - WiFi Firmware is expected to be part of the FILESYSTEM
 *
 *  Values can be decimal or hex (preceded by "0x").
