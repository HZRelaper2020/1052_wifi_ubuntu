 * In order to run unit tests with Check, we must create some test cases,
 * aggregate them into a suite, and run them with a suite runner.

 * The pattern of every unit test is as following

 * START_TEST(name_of_test){
 *
 *     perform tests;
 *	       ...assert results
 * }
 * END_TEST

 * Test Case is a set of at least 1 unit test
 * Test Suite is a collection of Test Cases
 * Check Framework can run multiple Test Suites.
 * More details will be on Twiki
