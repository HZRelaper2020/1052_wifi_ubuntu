 * Throughout the book I use snprintf() because it's safer than sprintf().
 * But as of the time of this writing, not all systems provide this
 * function.  The function below should only be built on those systems
 * that do not provide a real snprintf().
 * The function below just acts like sprintf(); it is not safe, but it
 * tries to detect overflow.
