 *  Implementation of wiced_rtos.c for the case where no RTOS is used
 *
 *  This is a special implementation of the Wiced RTOS
 *  abstraction layer, which is designed to make Wiced work even with
 *  no RTOS.
 *  It provides Wiced with alternates to the functions for threads,
 *  semaphores and time functions.
 *
 *  Semaphores are simple integers, since accesses to an integer will be atomic.
