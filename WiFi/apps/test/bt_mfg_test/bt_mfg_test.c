 * Bluetooth SmartBridge Manufacturing Test Application
 *
 * This application enables users to access the local Bluetooth
 * device using a PC manufacturing test application such as BlueTool.
 *
 * Application Instructions
 *   1. Connect a PC terminal to the serial port of the WICED Eval board,
 *      then build and download the application as described in the WICED
 *      Quick Start Guide
 *   2. Run BlueTool on your computer
 *   3. Select Transport | HCI Control | UART
 *   4. Enter the corresponding COM port and set the baud rate to 115200.
 *      Ensure that 'CTS flow control and 'SLIP/Three-wire' are unticked and then
 *      click 'OK'. The HCI command window appears
 *   5. Select View | Log Window. The log window appears
 *   6. Double-click on your desired HCI command to send
