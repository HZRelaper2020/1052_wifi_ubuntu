 * Home Appliance Control Application
 *
 * This application demonstrates how a simple web page can be used to send
 * information to a UART when a button on the webpage is clicked. The application
 * mimics a very basic user interface to control a home appliance such as a washing
 * machine or dryer.
 *
 * Features demonstrated
 *      - WICED Configuration Mode
 *      - Wi-Fi client mode
 *      - HTTP web server with the ability to serve dynamic content
 *      - mDNS (or Bonjour) network service broadcasting
 *      - Powersave
 *
 * Application Instructions
 *   1. Modify the CONFIG_AP_SSID/CONFIG_AP_PASSPHRASE Wi-Fi credentials
 *      in the wifi_config_dct.h header file as desired
 *   2. Connect a PC terminal to the serial port of the WICED Eval board,
 *      then build and download the application as described in the WICED
 *      Quick Start Guide
 *   3. After the download completes, the terminal displays WICED startup
 *      information and starts WICED Configuration Mode.
 *
 *   If you are unfamiliar with how WICED Configuration Mode works,
 *   please step through the config_mode snippet application in the
 *   apps/snip directory before proceeding further.
 *
 * Once the device has been configured then:
 *      - WICED connects as a client to the Wi-Fi AP selected during configuration mode
 *      - The app starts a web server that displays a web page with clickable buttons
 *      - A Wi-Fi client (eg. a computer) connected to the same home Wi-Fi network
 *    as the WICED module can then connect to the appliance web server using a web browser
 *
 * To view the Appliance web page in a web browser:
 *     - Open a web browser and go to http://192.168.1.99
 *       (replace this IP address with the IP of the WICED device; the IP
 *        address of the WICED device is available on the terminal after
 *        WICED Config Mode completes)
 *     - When a button on the webpage is clicked, button click information
 *       prints to the UART and is shown on the terminal
 *
 * Powersave Demonstration
 *   To demonstrate usage of the MCU & Wi-Fi powersave API in an application with
 *   an active network connection, a timed event is configured to intermittently
 *   enable, and then disable, MCU powersave mode. Using a WICED evaluation board,
 *   the power (current) profile can be measured on an oscilloscope by connecting
 *   to the testpoints labelled CURRENT & GND (J1). If you are unfamiliar with the
 *   WICED evaluation board or the WICED powersave API, refer to the WICED
 *   Evaluation Board User Guide and WICED Powersave Application Note in the
 *   <WICED-SDK>/Doc directory
 *

 * Notes.
 *   1. This application only works with Access Points configured for Open/WPA/WPA2
 *      security. It is not configured to work with APs that use WEP security!
 *   2. If your computer has an mDNS (or Bonjour) network service browser,
 *      the WICED device can be found by using the browser to search for
 *      and connect to the service called "Appliance Webserver". So this way
 *      you are able to discover the WICED device without relying on the IP
 *      address printed in the terminal.
