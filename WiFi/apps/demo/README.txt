WICED Application Demo Directory - README
----------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains advanced demonstration applications
that combine various WICED features into a single application

Applications in this directory are listed below.

 Home Appliance Control Application
    This application demonstrates how a simple web page can be used to send
    information to a UART when a button on a webpage is clicked. The application
    mimics a very basic user interface to control a home appliance such as a washing
    machine or dryer.

 Temperature Control & Report Application
     This application measures the temperature of the WICED evaluation
     board and sends temperature measurements to the 'Internet of Things' data
     warehouse http://xively.com/. The app also displays temperature & setpoint
     status on a local webpage.
