 *
 * This application should run on the device which needs to be controlled using IOT protocols and Cloud.
 * The device used here is LED1 on the WICED board.
 *
 * It has 2 states (ON/OFF) which could be controlled using one of the below mentioned topics which the device subscribes:
 * a) Name of this device (thing name). Whoever publishes message to this thing name (device) can control the device.
 *    This can be treated as SMART CONTROL of the device. This publish message can be triggered from one of the below:
 *    i) AWS Ice Breaker.
 *    ii) Other AWS Cloud service like Lambda.
 *    iii) Directly from remote sensor. We are using this for this demo.
 * b) AWS shadow for this thing name (device). This is used to create a virtual instance of this device in cloud.
 *    Users can get to know the status of the thing (device) by checking shadow. Also the device can be controlled using Shadow.
 *    This topic is derived from thing name which needs to be configured as already mentioned in item a) above.
 *    This can be treated as REMOTE CONTROL of the device.
 *
 * Also the device can be configured to be smart controlled or not using 2 ways:
 * i) Press SW3 button to allow/disallow smart control.
 * ii) Update "auto" element in "desired" object to "YES" or "NO" in AWS Shadow for the given thing name
 *
 * The device publishes to shadow when there is any change in its status.
 *
 * To demonstrate the app, work through the following steps.
 * 1. Make sure AWS Root Certifcate 'resources/apps/aws/iot/rootca.cer' is proper while building the app.
 * 2. Configuring the device using Web-UI:
 *    a) Connect from a PC to the device SSID "WICED_AWS" which runs as soft AP. SSID and credentials are as per DCT configuration.
 *    b) After successful connection, this device will act as WebServer with IP address 192.168.0.1.
 *    c) From host system type URL in browser as 192.168.0.1.
 *    d) Configure settings for thing name and upload certificate and private key. And join to a router which is connected to internet.
 *    e) The device will now reboot.
 * 3. The device will connect to selected Wi-Fi configurations. And then connect to broker.
 * 4. Try to control the device with one of the following:
 *    a) Start sensor app and try to get ON/OFF published to the device thing name.
 *    b) Update desired shadow status (ON/OFF) for the device thing name in the AWS IOT service.
 *    Item a) can be disabled/enabled by toggling the SW3 button on the device or by changing the "auto" state in the shadow to YES/NO.
