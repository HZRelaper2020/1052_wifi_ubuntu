 * Bluetooth Internet Gateway (BIG) RESTful smart server Demo Application
 * When the application comes up BIG will start a RESTful smart server and translate REST commands to BLE GATT client commands.
 *
 * To run the app, work through the following steps.
 * Modify Wi-Fi configuration settings CLIENT_AP_SSID and CLIENT_AP_PASSPHRASE in wifi_config_dct.h to match your router settings.
 *
 * To run and test the RESTful Smart Server, open up a HTTP client (such as Postman client or curl) that supports REST methods
 *
 * REST APIs are translated to BLE GATT commands such as scan, connect, read, write and notify.
 *
 *  Build and run this application.
