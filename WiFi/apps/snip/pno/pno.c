 * pno (preferred network offload) application
 *
 * This application snippet demonstrates how to use
 * the WICED preferred network offload APIs.
 *
 * Features demonstrated
 *  - STA association
 *  - disassociation detection
 *  - starting a preferred network background scan
 *  - handling preferred network detection to reassociate
 *
 * To demonstrate the app, work through the following steps.
 *  1. Modify the CLIENT_AP_SSID/CLIENT_AP_PASSPHRASE Wi-Fi credentials
 *     in the wifi_config_dct.h header file to match your Wi-Fi access point
 *  2. Plug the WICED eval board into your computer
 *  3. Open a terminal application and connect to the WICED eval board
 *  4. Build and download the application (to the WICED board)
 *  5. After the application has connected to your Wi-Fi access point, you will need to power down the AP,
 *  wait until app prints out message from detecting disconnect, then sometime later power the AP back on.
 *
 * After the download completes, the terminal displays WICED startup
 * information and then :
 *  - Joins a Wi-Fi network
 *  - Waits for a disconnect event to fire
 *  - Starts a pno scan for the AP which was just disconnected and waits for the AP to be found
 *  - Handles the AP being found again by re-connecting to the found AP
 *
 * TROUBLESHOOTING
 *  - Ensure AP information in the wifi_config_dct.h file in this directory is accurate.  E.g. CLIENT_AP_SSID
 *  needs to be defined to the APs SSID
 *
 * NOTES:
 *  - PNO may be used to do background scanning for several different APs at the same time.  This example only
 * has one preferred network.
