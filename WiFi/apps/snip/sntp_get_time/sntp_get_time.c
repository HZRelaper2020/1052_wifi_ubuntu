 * SNTP Get Time Application
 *
 * This application snippet demonstrates how to update the local
 * time from the network using SNTP
 *
 * Application Instructions
 *   1. Modify the CLIENT_AP_SSID/CLIENT_AP_PASSPHRASE Wi-Fi credentials
 *      in the wifi_config_dct.h header file to match your Wi-Fi access point
 *   2. Connect a PC terminal to the serial port of the WICED Eval board,
 *      then build and download the application as described in the WICED
 *      Quick Start Guide
 *
 * The application joins the AP and syncs the local time to a remote
 * server using SNTP. The time retrieved from the server is printed to
 * the UART.
