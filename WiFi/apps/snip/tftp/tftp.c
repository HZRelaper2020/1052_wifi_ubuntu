 * TFTP protocol and Upgrade
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------
 * PLEASE read the following documentation before trying
 * this application!
 * ------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * This application demonstrates how to use the WICED development board to demonstrate the trivial
 * file transfer protocol (TFTP) and use it for OTA upgrade.
 *
 * Features demonstrated
 *  - WICED OTA Upgrade
 *  - TFTP protocol
 *
 *  TFTP application:
 *  ==================
 *  The application requires an external TFTP application to be running on your PC. if the snip
 *  application is running as a server, then a tftp client application is required to be running
 *  on your machine. On the other hand, if your snip application is configured as a client, then
 *  a TFTP server is required to be running on your machine.
 *  The WICED TFTP implementation uses TFTP options and requires the opposing side to support those
 *  options. When picking a TFTP application to run on you machine, make sure it support TFTP options.
 *  Some TFTP applications include:
 *  TFTPGUIUtil (http://sourceforge.net/projects/tftputil/)
 *  tftpd32 (http://tftpd32.jounin.net/tftpd32_download.html)
 *  TFTP_Client Command line (https://tftpclient.codeplex.com/releases/view/104363)
 *
 *  Windows Security:
 *  ==================
 *  The below tests were conducted with windows fireware off. TFTP is a trivial non secure protocol. Windows firewall
 *  will probably block all applications communicating through it.
 *  It is important to make sure your firewall doens't block (or interfere) with your TFTP applications.
 *
 * WICED Multi-Application Support:
 * =================================
 * As of WICED-SDK 3.1.1, WICED Application Framework (WAF) supports loading and storing of multiple
 * application binaries in the external serial flash. Up to 8 binaries are supported. The first
 * five binaries are reserved for internal usage and the last three binaries are free for users to use.
 * The binaries are organised as follows:
 *  - Factory reset application (FR_APP)
 *  - DCT backup image (DCT_IMAGE)
 *  - OTA upgrade application (OTA_APP)
 *  - Resources file system (FILESYSTEM_IMAGE)
 *  - WIFI firmware (WIFI_FIRMWARE)
 *  - Application 0 (APP0)
 *  - Application 1 (APP1)
 *  - Application 2 (APP2)
 *
 * TFTP Snippet Application:
 * =========================
 * This snippet application demonstrates how to use TFTP protocol support to perform
 * file transfer and implement OTA upgrade. The following steps assume you have a BCM943362WCD4 WICED
 * evaluation board (a BCM943362WCD4 WICED module on a WICED evaluation board). If your board is different,
 * substitute BCM943362WCD4 for your platform name.
 *
 * Prepare the WICED evaluation board for OTA upgrade
 *     1. Build the snip.tftp application to function as your factory reset and OTA
 *        application. For more details on OTA and factory reset have a look at the OTA_FR snip application.
 *     2. Run the following make target to download your production and factory reset applications
 *        to the board:
 *            make snip.ota_fr-BCM943362WCD4 download download_apps run
 *     3. Build an application that will upgrade the current application.
 *        For this example we will build the snip.scan application:
 *            make snip.scan-BCM943362WCD4
 *     4. On your machine, Install a TFTP client that supports TFTP options (see the list above).
 * To read the DCT image
 *     5. Configure your TFTP client for 2 seconds time out and block size of 512 bytes.
 *     6. In the filename type dct.elf and run TFTP get.
 *     7. The terminal will show a print messages indicating tranfering files to your host machine.
 *     8. After the transfer your tftp folder on the client should include a dct.elf file
 * To write APP0 image
 *     5. Configure your TFTP client for 2 seconds time out and block size of 512 bytes.
 *     6. In the filename type app0.elf and run TFTP put.
 *     7. The terminal will show print messages indicating transferring files from your host machine.
 *     8. After the transfer the WICED will restart and run the new application.
