 * WPS Enrollee Application
 *
 * This application snippet demonstrates how to use the WPS Enrollee
 *
 * Features demonstrated
 *  - WPS Enrollee
 *
 * Application Instructions
 *   1. Connect a PC terminal to the serial port of the WICED Eval board,
 *      then build and download the application as described in the WICED
 *      Quick Start Guide
 *   2. Using a WPS capable Wi-Fi Access Point, press the WPS button on
 *      the AP to start a WPS setup session
 *   3. Connection progress is printed to the console
 *
 * The WPS Enrollee runs for up to 2 minutes before either successfully
 * connecting to the AP or timing out.
