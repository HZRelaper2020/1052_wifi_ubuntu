 * Stack Overflow Application
 *
 * Features demonstrated
 *  - How to set the application stack size
 *
 * The Application Stack
 *   The main application runs in its own thread, and just like
 *   every thread in the system, the app thread has a stack
 *   to manipulate local variables.
 *
 *   By default, the application thread stack size is set by the
 *   the #define WICED_DEFAULT_APPLICATION_STACK_SIZE in wiced_defaults.h.
 *
 *   To change the application stack size, the default stack size
 *   can be changed, or alternately, a global define can be added
 *   to the application makefile (located in the same directory as
 *   this file) as follows:
 *      #GLOBAL_DEFINES := APPLICATION_STACK_SIZE=XXXXX
 *
 * Overflowing the Stack
 *   If the application declares a local variable that requires more
 *   memory than is available on stack, the application stack will
 *   overflow.
 *
 *   This will have an indeterminate effect on the system, since
 *   the area of memory that is inadvertently overwritten may be
 *   critical to system operation, or it may be otherwise unused
 *   memory. Either way, it's a very bad idea to let this happen!
 *
 *   The demo included in this file calls a function that declares
 *   an array with 10240 bytes. Since the default application stack
 *   size is 6192 bytes, when the function is called, the stack
 *   is blown with unknown affects. In actual fact, since this app
 *   is so simple, there may not actually be any noticeable side
 *   effects -- but you can never be sure, and therein lies the
 *   trouble.
