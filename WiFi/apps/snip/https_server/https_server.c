 * HTTPS Webserver Application
 *
 * This app connects to a Wi-Fi network as a STA (client), then starts
 * a secure web-server and waits for requests.
 * It also starts a non-secure web-server which provides a redirect that
 * redirects any non-secure requests to the secure webpages.
 *
 * Features demonstrated
 *  - Wi-Fi STA (client) mode to serve HTTPS web pages
 *
 * Application Instructions
 *   1. Modify the CLIENT_AP_SSID/CLIENT_AP_PASSPHRASE Wi-Fi credentials
 *      in the wifi_config_dct.h header file to match your Wi-Fi access point
 *   2. Connect a PC terminal to the serial port of the WICED Eval board,
 *      then build and download the application as described in the WICED
 *      Quick Start Guide
 *   3. The app will display on the terminal :  Server ready at u.v.w.x
 *      Type this IP address into a web browser which is connected to
 *      the same Wi-Fi network as the WICED board.
 *      You will see the web browser load the secure web page.
