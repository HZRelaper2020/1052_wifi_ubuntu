 * Service Discovery Application
 *
 * Features demonstrated
 *  - Gedday service discovery library
 *
 * Application Instructions
 *  1. Modify the CLIENT_AP_SSID/CLIENT_AP_PASSPHRASE Wi-Fi credentials
 *     in wifi_config_dct.h header file to match your Wi-Fi access point.
 *  2. Connect MacBook to the same WiFi network which is used in step#1.
 *     Run dns-sd on MacBook using following command to host the mDNS service.
 *          $ dns-sd -R WicedmDNSService _wiced123 local 5353
 *  3. Build and download the application as described in WICED Quick Start Guide.
 *  4. Now WICED device should be able to discover the mDNS service on the network, which is hosted in step #2.
