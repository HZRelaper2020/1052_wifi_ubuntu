 *  This application demonstrates how to add files to your WICED application, and then open those files for read (read-only).
 *  In order to add your own resources to the application, the following assets must be installed in your WICED SDK tree:
 *
 *  resources/apps/resource_read/test_file01.txt
 *  resources/apps/resource_read/test_file02.txt
 *
 *  In general, you can add files to the filesystem by installing the file as:
 *
 *  resources/apps/<app-name>/<filename>
