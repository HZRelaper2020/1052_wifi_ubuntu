 * UART API Application
 *
 * This application demonstrates how to use the generic
 * WICED UART API to send and receive characters on the UART
 *
 * Features demonstrated
 *  - UART API
 *  - Ring buffer library
 *
 * Application Instructions
 *   Connect a PC terminal to the serial port of the WICED Eval board,
 *   then build and download the application as described in the WICED
 *   Quick Start Guide
 *
 *   Follow the prompts printed on the terminal
 *
 * NOTE

 *   Standard I/O definition (STDIO_UART) can be found in
 *   <WICED-SDK>/platforms/<Platform>/platform.h.
 *   To access STDIO_UART using the generic UART API,
 *   it is necessary to add a global define WICED_DISABLE_STDIO
 *   in the uart.mk application makefile
 *
