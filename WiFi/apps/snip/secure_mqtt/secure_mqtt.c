 * Send/Receive MQTT Application
 *
 * This application snippet demonstrates how to use
 * the WICED MQTT client library.
 *
 * Features demonstrated
 *  - MQTT Client initiation
 *  - MQTT Client publish (sending / receiving)
 *  - MQTT Client subscribing
 *
 * To demonstrate the app, work through the following steps.
 *  1. Modify the CLIENT_AP_SSID/CLIENT_AP_PASSPHRASE Wi-Fi credentials
 *     in the wifi_config_dct.h header file to match your Wi-Fi access point
 *  2. Modify the MQTT_BROKER_ADDRESS with your MQTT broker( currently using test.mosquitto.org).
 *  3. Plug the WICED eval board into your computer
 *  4. Open a terminal application and connect to the WICED eval board
 *  5. Build and download the application (to the WICED board)
 *
 * Before running the application on the WICED, Make sure your network settings in which Mqtt ports(1883, 8883-secured) are enabled.
 *
 * After the download completes, the terminal displays WICED startup
 * information and then :
 *  - Joins a Wi-Fi network
 *  - Starts an MQTT connection with the server
 *  - Subscribe for a MQTT/WICED/TOPIC topic.
 *  - Publish "Hello WICED" to the same topic
 *  - Received "Hello WICED" from the mqtt deamon.
 *  - Close the MQTT connection
 *
 *SECURITY:
 *  Security in MQTT is done through TLS. This application is testing MQTT over TLS.
 *  We are securely connecting to public broker(test.mosquitto.org)
 *  Root certifcate is of mosquitto.org is in resources/apps/secure_mqtt/secure_mqtt_root_cacert.cer
 *
 *  NOTE : Application uses only root CA certificate.
 *
 *TROUBLESHOOTING
 *   If you are having difficulty connecting the MQTT broker,
 *   Make sure your Broker is configured correctly
 *
 * NOTES:
 *
 *  - Retransmission: WICED MQTT provides two types of retransmission
 *    * Session continue retransmission: When a session is not set as clean, retransmission
 *      of any queued packets from previous session is done once a connect ACK is received.
 *      Session retransmission is part of the MQTT standard.
 *    * In session retransmission: This basically means trying to resend un ACKed packets.
 *      MQTT left this as an application specific and didn't indicate if/when retransmissions
 *      should occur.  WICED MQTT does retransmissions for unACKed packets on the reception
 *      of a PINGRES (ping response) from the deamon. If keep_alive is disabled (not recommended
 *      , in sessions retransmissions will be disabled.
 *
 *  - The MQTT library doesn't protect against user errors, i.e if a user decided to send a
 *    wrong command in a wrong time, the MQTT library won't stop him. The server would signal
 *    an error though.
 *
 *  - Calling MQTT APIs from the event handler call back functions is possible. The only exception
 *    is the wiced_mqtt_deinit which terminates the thread where the call back is being
 *    issued from.
