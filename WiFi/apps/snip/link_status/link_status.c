 * Link Status Application
 *
 * This application demonstrates how to asynchronously handle
 * changes in the Wi-Fi link connection status.
 *
 * Features demonstrated
 *  - Wi-Fi client mode
 *  - Wi-Fi link status callback API
 *
 * Application Instructions
 *   1. Modify the CLIENT_AP_SSID/CLIENT_AP_PASSPHRASE Wi-Fi credentials
 *      in the wifi_config_dct.h header file to match your Wi-Fi access point
 *   2. Connect a PC terminal to the serial port of the WICED Eval board,
 *      then build and download the application as described in the WICED
 *      Quick Start Guide
 *
 * After download, the app joins the configured AP as a client.
 * To demonstrate the link up/link down API:
 *   - Power OFF the AP
 *   - Wait for a link down message to appear on the terminal
 *   - Power ON the AP
 *   - Wait for a link up message to appear on the terminal
 *
