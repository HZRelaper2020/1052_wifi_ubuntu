 * BCM943907WAE_1 Power Management Application
 *
 * This application snippet demonstrates the power management
 * api for the BCM943907WAE_1 board. This app initializes the
 * Maxim17040 and Maxim8971 on-board chips and monitors the
 * charger and battery status. This app can be used to generate
 * comma-delimited data which can be exported to excel and used
 * to generate power curves. Power curve data can provide useful
 * information on the discharge characteristics of various
 * batteries as well as the power consumption and runtime of
 * various applications.
 *
 * Features demonstrated
 *  - Power Management API
 *    - Maxim17040 chip functionality
 *    - Maxim8971  chip functionality
 *
 * Application Instructions
 *   Setup:
 *     1. This application requires console - Connect a debug board and usb cable.
 *     2. Connect a battery to the battery port on a BCM943907WAE_1 board.
 *     3. Connect a usb cable to the usb port.
 *     4. Set the max runtime of the application (if known) in the init function.
 *   Charge the Battery:
 *     1. If necessary, wait until the battery is fully charged.
 *        You can monitor the charging status by observing the
 *        state of charge (SOC), checking the update function's
 *        return flag field, or enabling printing and watching
 *        for the done charging message.
 *   Collect Data:
 *     1. Unplug the battery and power usb.
 *     2. Open a console using PuTTY and enable:
 *        Change Settings > Session > Logging > All session output
 *     3. Plug in the fully charged battery.
 *        The PuTTY terminal should show comma-delimited data.
 *        Data should be collected approximately once a minute.
 *   Export Data:
 *     1. Wait until the battery dies and the board powers off.
 *     2. Open the log file and copy/paste all data into excel.
 *     3. Highlight the entire column and follow the instructions in:
 *        Data > Text to Columns
 *        to break the data into individual columns.
 *     4. The data should be of the form:
 *        <minutes elapsed> <volts> <SOC> <minutes remaining>
 *     5. You can graph Voltage vs. Time to generate a power curve.
 *
 * NOTE:
 *  - This application ONLY works on the BCM943907WAE_1 board. It will
 *    build on other boards, but they lack the Maxim hardware and
 *    are NOT supported by this power management api.
