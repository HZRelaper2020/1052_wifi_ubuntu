 * Factory Reset Application
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------
 * PLEASE read the following documentation before trying
 * this application!
 * ------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * This application reboots or causes a factory_reset on the next boot.
 * It is meant to be used with snip.ota_fr on boards that do not have a "Factory Reset" button.
 *
 * Features demonstrated
 *  - Factory Reset process
 *
 * WICED Multi-Application Support:
 * =================================
 * As of WICED-SDK 3.1.1, WICED Application Framework (WAF) supports loading and storing of multiple
 * application binaries in the external serial flash. Up to 8 binaries are supported. The first
 * five binaries are reserved for internal usage and the last three binaries are free for users to use.
 * The binaries are organised as follows:
 *  - Factory reset application (FR_APP)
 *  - DCT backup image (DCT_IMAGE)
 *  - OTA upgrade application (OTA_APP)
 *  - Resources file system (FILESYSTEM_IMAGE)
 *  - WIFI firmware (WIFI_FIRMWARE)
 *  - Application 0 (APP0)
 *  - Application 1 (APP1)
 *  - Application 2 (APP2)
 *
 * Snippet Application:
 * =========================
 * Follow the instructions in snip/ota_fr/ota_fr.c to build and run that application.
 * In Step 4, use this application instead of snip.scan
 *            make snip.ota_fr_no_buttons-<PLATFORM>
 *
 * Perform factory reset from the console by typing 'factory_reset'
 *   > factory_reset
 *
 *   - The WICED evaluation board will reboot and run the factory reset (OTA_FR) application.
 *     Observe the log messages at the terminal to confirm the factory reset is completed successfully.
