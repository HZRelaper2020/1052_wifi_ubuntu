# The 20706A2/43012C0 BT embedded applications are capable of interacting with 43xxx_WiFi MCU applications
# The embedded applications serve to abstract the details of Bluetooth protocols and profiles while allowing MCU application to handle with the business logic.
# The apps processor is typically connected over UART and can send commands and receive notifications.

# Follow these instructions, in order for 43xxx_WiFi MCU applications to work with Embedded BT application (applies to 20706A2 and 43012C0 based platforms):
# 1.) Set the BLUETOOTH_AUDIO_APP_MODE flag to BT_EMBED_MODE in the application Makefile to run the application in embedded mode. Or set the
#     BLUETOOTH_AUDIO_APP_MODE flag to BT_HYBRID_MODE in the application Makefile to run the application in hybrid mode
# 2.) By default, the Makefile picks the default bt_firmware_embedded_(EMBEDDED_APP_NAME).c firmware file,
# that is present in libraries/drivers/bluetooth/firmware/. Refer to the firmware.mk file for details.
# 3.) The application running on MCU shall use WICED_HCI mode to communicate with the Bluetooth embedded application
#
# To build a custom BT embedded application, follow the below steps:
# 1.) Open the 20706/43012 embedded application present under the respective Chip project in the WICED Studio IDE
# 2.) Modify/enhance the embedded application as desired.
# 3.) Build application to produce a downloadable hcd file.  For example
#     demo.headset-CYW920706WCDEVAL DIRECT_LOAD=1 build
# 4.) Convert '.hcd' file generated above to byte-array in a 'C' file using hcd2c.pl script.
#     Use the hcd2c.pl present under libraries/drivers/bluetooth/firmware/tools to generate the C file.
#     Sample command: perl hcd2c.pl -n headset-CYW920706WCDEVAL_40Mhz-rom-ram-Wiced-release.hcd > firmware.c
# 5.) Make sure that 'C' file generated above is syntatically correct and uses 'brcm_patchram_buf' and brcm_patch_ram_length' names
#      to represent byte-array and byte-array length
#     For example :
#        const uint8_t brcm_patchram_buf[] = { << byte_array here >> };
#        const int brcm_patch_ram_length = sizeof(brcm_patchram_buf);
#     For reference, check this file: bt_firmware_embedded_headset.c file.
# 6.) Rename this C file to bt_firmware_embedded_(EMBEDDED_APP_NAME).c and place under the respective BT_CHIP folder in the firmware path mentioned above.
# 7.) The 43xx_Wifi_MCU application will link & compile the updated C file.
#
# To Automate the above mentioned steps from 2) to 6), make the following changes in the make file:
#     a) Enable REBUILD_BLUETOOTH_FIRMWARE flag to 1.
#     b) Enter the desired Embedded Application target make string to MAKE_STRING flag.
#     c) Enter the desired Embedded Application name to EMBEDDED_APP_NAME flag.
#     d) Enter the Bluetooth XTAL freq to BT_CHIP_XTAL.
#     e) The Bluetooth chip name will be taken by default from the Platform file.
#     NOTE: By doing this step, the existing firmware file will be over written by the new firmware file.
#           However,the existing firmware file would be backed up as bt_firmware_embedded_back_(app_name).c in the same folder structure.
