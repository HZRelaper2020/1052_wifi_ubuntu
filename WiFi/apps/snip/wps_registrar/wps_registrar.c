 * WPS Registrar Application
 *
 * This application snippet demonstrates how to use the
 * WPS Registrar on an existing softAP interface.
 *
 * Features demonstrated
 *  - Wi-Fi softAP mode
 *  - WPS Registrar
 *
 * Application Instructions
 *   1. Connect a PC terminal to the serial port of the WICED Eval board,
 *      then build and download the application as described in the WICED
 *      Quick Start Guide
 *   2. Using a WPS capable device (Windows PC, Android device),
 *      search for the WICED softAP "WPS_REGISTRAR_EXAMPLE" using
 *      the Wi-Fi setup method for the device
 *   3. Attempt to connect to the WICED softAP using WPS
 *   4. Connection progress is printed to the console
 *
 *   The application starts a softAP, and then immediately enables
 *   the WPS registrar which runs for 2 minutes before timing out.
 *   If your WPS capable device does not connect within the 2 minute
 *   window, reset the WICED eval board and try again.
 *
 *   Results are printed to the terminal.
 *
 * Notes
 *   1. A Windows client detects that WPS is enabled on the softAP
 *      and automatically attempts to connect using PBC mode
 *      Windows does not support PIN mode.
 *   2. Apple iOS devices such as iPhones DO NOT support WPS.
