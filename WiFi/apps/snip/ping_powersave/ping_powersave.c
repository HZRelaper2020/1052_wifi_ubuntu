 * Ping Powersave Application
 *
 * This application snippet demonstrates how to minimise power
 * consumption for a connected device that does NOT require high
 * throughput. Please read the WICED Powersave Application Note
 * to familiarise yourself with the WICED powersave implementation
 * before using this application.
 *
 * Features demonstrated
 *  - Wi-Fi client mode
 *  - ICMP ping
 *  - MCU powersave
 *  - Wi-Fi powersave
 *
 * Application Instructions
 *   1. Modify the CLIENT_AP_SSID/CLIENT_AP_PASSPHRASE Wi-Fi credentials
 *      in the wifi_config_dct.h header file to match your Wi-Fi access point
 *   2. Connect a PC terminal to the serial port of the WICED Eval board,
 *      then build and download the application as described in the WICED
 *      Quick Start Guide
 *
 *  After initialisation, the application loops through the following
 *  sequence forever:
 *   - sends an ICMP ping to the gateway
 *   - suspends network timers
 *   - enters low power mode for WIFI_SLEEP_TIME seconds
 *   - resumes network timers
 *
 * NOTES :
 *   To use a Wi-Fi powersave mode that enables higher throughput,
 *   comment the USE_POWERSAVE_POLL directive
 *
