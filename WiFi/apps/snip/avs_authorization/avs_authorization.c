 /* AVS Authorization
 *
 * This application snippet helps to generate the refresh token for AVS( Amazon Voice Services).
 *
 *  NOTE : Before running this application on WICED, AVS registration is needed for certain
 *         informational parameters as part of the demo
 *
 * To demonstrate the app, work through the following steps.
 *  1. Modify the CLIENT_AP_SSID/CLIENT_AP_PASSPHRASE Wi-Fi credentials
 *     in the wifi_config_dct.h header file to match your Wi-Fi access point
 *  3. Plug the WICED eval board into your computer
 *  4. Open a terminal application and connect to the WICED eval board
 *  5. Build and download the application (to the WICED board)
 *
 * After the download completes, the terminal displays WICED startup
 * information and then :
 *  - Joins a Wi-Fi network
 *  .
 *  Open a web browser on your computer connected to same Wi-Fi access point that the eval board
 *  is connected to and type in the ip address of the wiced device along with the port.
 *  Enter the details related to AVS on the webpage hosted by the eval board
 *  The page should direct to amazon website, login using your AVS registered account
 *  The token gets generated which can be downloaded to a text file.
