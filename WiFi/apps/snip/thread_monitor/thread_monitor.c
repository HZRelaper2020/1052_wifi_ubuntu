 * Thread Monitor Application
 *
 * This application demonstrates how to use the WICED
 * System Monitor API to monitor the operation of the
 * application thread.
 *
 * Features demonstrated
 *  - WICED System Monitor
 *
 * Application Instructions
 *   Connect a PC terminal to the serial port of the WICED Eval board,
 *   then build and download the application as described in the WICED
 *   Quick Start Guide
 *
 *   After the download completes, the app:
 *    - Registers a thread monitor with the WICED system monitor
 *    - Loops 10 times, each time notifying the system monitor that
 *      the thread is working normally
 *    - An unexpected delay is then simulated
 *    - A short time AFTER the unexpected delay occurs, the
 *      watchdog bites and the WICED eval board reboots
 *
 *  The watchdog timeout period is set in the thread_monitor.mk makefile
 *  using the global variable : APPLICATION_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT_SECONDS
