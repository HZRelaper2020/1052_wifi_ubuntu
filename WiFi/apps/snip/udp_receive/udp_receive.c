 * UDP Receive Application
 *
 * This application snippet demonstrates how to receive a UDP packet
 * from a network client (and optionally send a response)
 *
 * Features demonstrated
 *  - Wi-Fi softAP mode
 *  - DHCP server
 *  - UDP receive (and response)
 *
 * Application Instructions
 *   1. Connect a PC terminal to the serial port of the WICED Eval board,
 *      then build and download the application as described in the WICED
 *      Quick Start Guide
 *   2. Ensure Python 2.7.x (*NOT* 3.x) is installed on your computer
 *   3. Connect your computer using Wi-Fi to "WICED UDP Receive App"
 *        - SoftAP credentials are defined in wifi_config_dct.h
 *   4. Open a command shell
 *   5. Run the python UDP transmit script as follows from the udp_receive dir
 *      c:\<WICED-SDK>\Apps\snip\udp_receive> c:\path\to\Python27\python.exe udp_transmit.py
 *        - Ensure your firewall allows UDP for Python on port 50007
 *
 *   The WICED application starts a softAP, and then regularly checks to
 *   see if a UDP packet has been received from a connected client.
 *   An optional response is sent directly to the client.
 *
 *   The udp_transmit script sends a broadcast UDP packet from your computer
 *   to the WICED application. The received packet contents are extracted by the
 *   WICED application and printed to the terminal.
 *
 *   To disable the UDP response, comment out the #define SEND_UDP_RESPONSE
 *
 *   The network to be used can be changed by the #define WICED_NETWORK_INTERFACE in wifi_config_dct.h
 *   In the case of using AP or STA mode, change the AP_SSID and AP_PASSPHRASE accordingly.
 *
