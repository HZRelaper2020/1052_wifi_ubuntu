 * WICED Configuration Mode Application
 *
 * This application demonstrates how to use WICED Configuration Mode
 * to automatically configure application parameters and Wi-Fi settings
 * via a softAP and webserver
 *
 * Features demonstrated
 *  - WICED Configuration Mode
 *
 * Application Instructions
 *   1. Connect a PC terminal to the serial port of the WICED Eval board,
 *      then build and download the application as described in the WICED
 *      Quick Start Guide
 *   2. After the download completes, the terminal displays WICED startup
 *      information and starts WICED configuration mode.
 *
 * In configuration mode, application and Wi-Fi configuration information
 * is entered via webpages using a Wi-Fi client (eg. your computer)
 *
 * Use your computer to step through device configuration using WICED Config Mode
 *   - Connect the computer using Wi-Fi to the config softAP "WICED Config"
 *     The config AP name & passphrase is defined in the file <WICED-SDK>/include/default_wifi_config_dct.h
 *     The AP name/passphrase is : Wiced Config / 12345678
 *   - Open a web browser and type wiced.com in the URL
 *     (or enter 192.168.0.1 which is the IP address of the softAP interface)
 *   - The Application configuration webpage appears. This page enables
 *     users to enter application specific information such as contact
 *     name and address details for device registration
 *   - Change one of more of the fields in the form and then click 'Save settings'
 *   - Click the Wi-Fi Setup button
 *   - The Wi-Fi configuration page appears. This page provides several options
 *     for configuring the device to connect to a Wi-Fi network.
 *   - Click 'Scan and select network'. The device scans for Wi-Fi networks in
 *     range and provides a webpage with a list.
 *   - Enter the password for your Wi-Fi AP in the Password box (top left)
 *   - Find your Wi-Fi AP in the list, and click the 'Join' button next to it
 *
 * Configuration mode is complete. The device stops the softAP and webserver,
 * and attempts to join the Wi-Fi AP specified during configuration. Once the
 * device completes association, application configuration information is
 * printed to the terminal
 *
 * The wiced.com URL reference in the above text is configured in the DNS
 * redirect server. To change the URL, edit the list in
 * <WICED-SDK>/Library/daemons/dns_redirect.c
 * URLs currently configured are:
 *      # http://www.cypress.com , http://cypress.com ,
 *      # http://www.facebook.com , http://facebook.com ,
 *      # http://www.google.com   , http://google.com   ,
 *      # http://www.bing.com     , http://bing.com     ,
 *      # http://www.apple.com    , http://apple.com    ,
 *      # http://www.wiced.com    , http://wiced.com    ,
 *
 *  *** IMPORTANT NOTE ***
 *   The config mode API will be integrated into Wi-Fi Easy Setup when
 *   WICED-SDK-3.0.0 is released.
